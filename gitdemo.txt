Terminology in Git :

→ In Git a project is considered as  a REPOSITORY (or)  repo
→ the current working directory is considered as Working Directory 
→ there is a process called staging 
→ commit  is git way of saving our Working Directory 


Work Flow : 

Working Directory → Modified files → Staging Area → Commited


Configuring Git:

 #git  configure --global user.name “dhanunjaya”
 #git  configure --global user.email  “company.abab@gmail.com”
 #git  configure --list

→ Creating Working Directory 

#mkdir git
#cd git 
#mkdir project 
#cd project
#touch file


To keep tracking of this project working directory use this command

#git init



→ Modifing Files in working Directory 

#touch file //edit the file

→ Staging Area:

# git status
#git add -A ( adding file to git)
#git status

→ Commited

#git commit -m ‘ type message ‘


Restoring the files in git 

#git checkout -- .
